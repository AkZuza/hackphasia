# TARA - Semantic Search Engine for Drone Patents

Welcome to TARA, a basic NLP engine designed for semantic searches on drone-based patents. TARA is a lightweight tool that allows you to quickly search and retrieve information from a dataset of drone-related patents. Unlike complex NLP engines, TARA focuses on simplicity and efficiency for patent-related queries.

## Overview

TARA is specifically tailored for users interested in exploring drone patents. It provides a straightforward interface for semantic searches, allowing you to input queries related to drone technology and receive relevant patent information.

## Features

### 1. Semantic Search

TARA uses a simple yet effective semantic search approach to match user queries with drone patents. Enter your question or keyword, and TARA will retrieve patents that semantically match your input.

### 2. Query Syntax

TARA understands common language queries related to drone technology. You can ask questions or use keywords to search for patents without worrying about complex query syntax.

### 3. Patent Information

Retrieve essential information about patents, including titles, publication years, and links to the original documents. TARA aims to provide concise and relevant patent details for easy reference.

## How to Use

Using TARA is straightforward:

1. **Input your Query:** Type your question or keywords related to drone technology.

2. **Submit:** Hit the search button, and TARA will process your query to find matching patents.

3. **Review Results:** Explore the list of patents that match your query. Each result includes the patent title, publication year, and a link to the original document.

## Example Queries

- How are drones used in agriculture?
- What patents involve autonomous drone navigation?
- Retrieve patents related to drone delivery systems.

## Limitations

TARA is designed for basic semantic searches and may not include advanced NLP features such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) or word embeddings. It aims to provide quick and accessible information for users interested in drone patents.

## About

TARA is a project developed for the exploration of drone-related patents. It is not intended for commercial use or as a comprehensive patent analysis tool. The engine is named after Tara, the goddess of knowledge in Hinduism, symbolizing the wisdom and insights TARA aims to provide.
